 Thanks for your input. 
 I am sure I have a larger electrical problem. 
 Whast would you say is the best way to go about diagnosing it?

 The VSS not working long enough should at least trip one code not to mention with all the other problems you are having there is likely to be some other stuff going on. As for tracing electrical issues....find a mechanice who specializes in this or is good at it. Or even one who is just willing. Most mechanics (at least from my experience) despise looking for electrical problems since they can occur virtually anywhere in the looms all around the car.  
 If all that stuff went bad at once though, its safe to say something major is at fault and that should make it easier to pinpoint.

 Looking at buying a used 1992 Legend, and it says they requior premium fuel. Will it run on regular? with gas prices paying that much more for premium Fuel on a 14 year old car seems abit too expensive. Will the Legend run on regular or will that mess up with the engine?

 I have a '92 Legend Coupe, and indeed they prefer premium. But the computer will compensate if you use regular. It seems to do just fine.  
 The difference, however, is a substantial drop in performance   , since one of the things that is different with regular is if the timing is as advanced as much as with premium, you will get preignition or detonation, which is worse. And the '92 has a clever enough computer to prevent those conditions.  
 So. The bottom line for me is this: premium gas is about 6% more expensive 'round Southern California than is regular. But I seem to get about 8% better gas mileage with premium than I do with regular. This negates any seeming economy, so why would I use regular? I no longer do. Looking at the hard dollars, the premium gas is more economical, even though by a slight margin. At the same time, the car is more fun to drive, and it doesn't cost me a dime   .  
 Hope this helps.  
 Don.
